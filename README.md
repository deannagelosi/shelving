## Object Placement

- gravity - bottom "row" shapes drop to ground
- change min white space minesweeper number to ratio
- change overlap penalty to ratio (greater than adding enough white space to fix it)
- end when there are no more 8s
- add center of gravity into scoring
- multiple anneal passes

## Build Shelves

## UI

- print boundary colors and shapes
- freeze shapes in layout
- stop button: good initial state, or stuck
- re-anneal button
- add option for empty spaces to fill later
- hang on wall (center of gravity is ignored) vs flat on table (requires flat bottoms)
