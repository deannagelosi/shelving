# ToDo

## Initial Solution

1. Place the first object from an array and place it in the design space
2. Repeat until all objects are placed
3. Returns
    1. Map data
        1. 2D array of integers representing overlaps: 0 is empty, 1 is occupied, 2+ is overlap
    2. Object data
        1. x,y coordinates
        2. name
        3. weight
        4. etc

## Visualize

1. Shows map with overlaps
2. Score (see objective function)
