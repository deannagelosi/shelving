# todo

## Demo (Next Wednesday)

- merge dots into lines
- build perimeter for case
- detect joints
- anneal -> automata
- better failure catching, regenerate from scratch

## Stretch

- is counting 8's encouraging narrow solutions? less cells added when growing narrow
- input new shapes
- input -> anneal -> automaton
- center of mass: another scoring mechanism
- export to svgs
- check solution.txt for bugs

## Unusual Cases

- support small library of alternative perimeters
- support user supplied custom perimeters
- score penalty when out of bounds

## Alternative Workflows

- freeze shapes in layout
- stop button: good initial state, or stuck
- re-anneal button
- add option for empty spaces to fill later
- hang on wall (center of gravity is ignored) vs flat on table (requires flat bottoms)
